# Summit Hikes Session State

## Task: Add a sort and filter by hike time feature to the app

## Completed Tasks:
1. ✅ Examined the database schema - found `hiking_time_min` and `hiking_time_max` columns
2. ✅ Updated the API endpoint to support hike time filtering:
   - Added `min_time` parameter to filter by minimum hike time
   - Added `hiking_time_min` and `hiking_time_max` to sort options
3. ✅ Added hike time filter controls to FilterControls component:
   - Added `hikeTimeRange` prop
   - Added `onHikeTimeRangeChange` prop
   - Added handlers for min/max hike time changes
   - Added UI section for hike time range (0-24 hours, 0.5 step)
4. ✅ Updated App.jsx to handle hike time filtering logic:
   - Added `hikeTimeRange` state with default { min: 0, max: 24 }
   - Added filtering logic to check if hikes fall within the time range
   - Added `handleHikeTimeRangeChange` handler
   - Added hike time range to reset filters function
   - Passed new props to FilterControls component
5. ✅ Added hike time sort options to HikesDisplay component:
   - Added "Min Hike Time" and "Max Hike Time" to sort options

## Testing Status:
- ✅ Backend API restarted and running on http://localhost:8000
- ✅ Frontend is running on http://localhost:5173
- ✅ API filtering tested - successfully filters hikes by minimum time (e.g., min_time=5 returns 36 hikes)
- ✅ API sorting tested - successfully sorts by hiking_time_min and hiking_time_max
- ✅ Hike time filtering works correctly with the overlap logic

## Testing Results:
- Filtering by min_time=5 returns 36 hikes (out of 50 total)
- Sorting by hiking_time_min shows hikes ordered from shortest to longest
- Data quality note: Cooper Peak has 0.0-0.0 hours, which might need investigation

## Feature Complete:
The hike time filter and sort feature has been successfully implemented and tested. Users can now:
1. Filter hikes by time range using a slider (0-24 hours in 0.5 hour increments)
2. Sort hikes by minimum or maximum hike time
3. The filter uses overlap logic to show hikes where any part of their time range overlaps with the selected filter range

- `/Users/collinsinclair/Developer/summit-hikes/summit-hikes-app/src/components/FilterControls.jsx`
- `/Users/collinsinclair/Developer/summit-hikes/summit-hikes-app/src/App.jsx`
- `/Users/collinsinclair/Developer/summit-hikes/summit-hikes-app/src/components/HikesDisplay.jsx`

## Important Notes:
- The hike time filter uses an overlap check: it shows hikes where any part of their time range overlaps with the selected filter range
- Some hikes may have 0 values for hiking times (need to check data quality)
- The UI allows filtering from 0-24 hours in 0.5 hour increments
